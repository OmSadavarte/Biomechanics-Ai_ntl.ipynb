## About The Project 
During the dire times of a Covid Epidemic,biometric logging has proven to be cumbersome and fatal.
We at StarX company have aimed to create a platform making use of Ai,
Computer Vision and ML to develop Cyclops - a model which provides
real-time surveillance and intruder detection, aligning with a real-time attendance tracker made with
state-of-the art azure Face Api.
Security is one of the most key concern of people in current world. 
Advanced surveillance systems are now being used widely for detecting suspicious act in real time.
We provide our services in the form of Web as well as App, hence information is now handy and readily available.
<br>
<br>


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Objective
- Create awarness of Ai/ML in the Field of Security.
- Improving the productivity of employees by keeping a track of their general activities.
- Store live activity of individuals in the company vicinity.

<br>
<br>

## Novelty of our project
Our project is a practical representation of Computer Vision in a real-life problem,it makes a starking attempt to 
help the companies and individuals in security and personal safety.
Face recognition is a constantly evolving field of study.Making use of azure Face api we deliver live survelliance and 
storing of images on azure cloud.
We also provide you with a web interface with backend support and working App developed with flutter.
