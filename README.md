## About The Project 
During the dire times of a Covid Epidemic,biometric logging has proven to be cumbersome and fatal.
We at BiomechanicsAi have aimed to create a platform making use of Ai,
Computer Vision and ML to develop Ergonomics assesment system with posture detection - a model which provides
<br>
<br>


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Objective
- Create awarness of Ai/ML in the Field of Physiology and MSD healthcare.
- Improving the quality of health of employees by keeping a track of their neck positioning and body stance(standing+sitting).
- Store and display their REBA & RULA assestment scores real-time.

<br>

## Novelty of our project
Our project is a practical representation of Computer Vision in a real-life problem,it makes a starking attempt to 
help the companies and individuals in ergonomics and personal safety.
We also provide you with a web interface with backend support.

## Future Scope
- Integration with Smart Camera and iot.
- Real-Time Geolocation Support.
- Added User Authority and User Authentication.
- Improved model accuracy alng with mask-wear detection and logging.
- Successive support in Low-light conditions with the help of remarkable DL libs.
- Attendance System.
- Timesheet management to easily calculate hours and have all the data about employee work
